## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

- `src/app/doctor-onboarding/page.tsx`: Main onboarding component
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx`: Enhanced doctor profile page
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- React hooks for state management

### Backend APIs

- `POST /api/doctors/register`: Complete doctor registration
- `POST /api/doctors/verify-hprid`: HPRID verification
- `GET /api/doctors/:id`: Fetch doctor profile

### Database Collections

- `doctors`: Doctor profile information
- `hpridVerifications`: HPRID verification records
- `userData`: General user data

## HPRID Verification

The system includes a mock HPRID (Health Professional Registration ID) verification system:

### Verification Process

1. Doctor enters HPRID number
2. System validates format (minimum 10 characters, alphanumeric)
3. Mock API call simulates real verification (2-3 second delay)
4. Verification result stored in database
5. Visual feedback provided to user

### Mock Verification Rules

- HPRID must be at least 10 characters long
- Must contain only alphanumeric characters
- Case-insensitive validation
- Real implementation would integrate with actual medical board APIs

## Security Features

### Data Protection

- All sensitive information encrypted
- HIPAA compliance considerations
- Secure file upload for profile photos
- Input validation and sanitization

### Verification

- Required HPRID verification before profile activation
- Medical license number validation
- Professional credentials review process

## UI/UX Features

### Design Elements

- Modern, medical-themed interface
- Step-by-step wizard design
- Progress indicators
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Professional color scheme (blue/green medical theme)

### User Experience

- Clear instructions at each step
- Real-time validation feedback
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success confirmations
- Loading states for async operations
