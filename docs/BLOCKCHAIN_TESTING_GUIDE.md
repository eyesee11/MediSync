# üîó Blockchain Testing Guide for MediSync

## Overview

This guide will help you test the complete blockchain functionality implemented in MediSync, including smart contracts, IPFS integration, and frontend interfaces.

## üéØ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Smart Contract (PatientDataConsent.sol)

- **Location**: `blockchain/contracts/PatientDataConsent.sol`
- **Features**:
  - Medical record upload and storage
  - Doctor approval system with access control
  - IPFS hash storage for decentralized file storage
  - Event emission for transparency
  - Owner and approver management

### 2. Blockchain Services

- **Contract Service**: `src/lib/blockchain/contract.ts`
- **IPFS Service**: `src/lib/blockchain/ipfs.ts`
- **Features**:
  - MetaMask wallet integration
  - Smart contract interaction
  - File encryption and IPFS upload
  - Record retrieval and approval

### 3. Frontend Interface

- **Test Page**: `src/app/blockchain-test/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Wallet connection
  - Record upload simulation
  - Approval workflow demonstration

## üß™ Testing Methods

### Method 1: Automated Smart Contract Testing

1. **Navigate to blockchain directory**:

   ```bash
   cd blockchain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if not done):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile smart contract**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Run comprehensive tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test test/test-functionality.js
   ```

**Expected Results**:

- ‚úÖ Contract deployment successful
- ‚úÖ Medical record upload and approval workflow
- ‚úÖ Access control and permissions
- ‚úÖ Record statistics and data integrity

### Method 2: Local Blockchain Network Testing

1. **Start local Hardhat network** (in one terminal):

   ```bash
   cd blockchain
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. **Deploy contract** (in another terminal):

   ```bash
   cd blockchain
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

3. **Note the deployed contract address** for frontend integration.

### Method 3: Frontend Demo Testing

1. **Start the Next.js development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the test page**:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/blockchain-test
   ```

3. **Test wallet connection**:

   - Install MetaMask browser extension
   - Connect wallet to the test page
   - Observe wallet address display

4. **Test record upload**:

   - Fill in record type and description
   - Click "Upload to Blockchain"
   - Verify record appears in the list

5. **Test approval workflow**:
   - Click "Approve as Doctor" on pending records
   - Verify status changes to approved

## üìä Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Patient Record Upload

1. Patient uploads medical record with IPFS hash
2. Record is stored on blockchain with pending status
3. Patient cannot approve their own record (access control)

### Scenario 2: Doctor Approval

1. Doctor (with approver role) reviews pending record
2. Doctor approves record, changing status to approved
3. Doctor's address is recorded as the approving physician

### Scenario 3: Data Integrity

1. Multiple records uploaded by different patients
2. All records maintain separate state and permissions
3. IPFS hashes ensure immutable file references

### Scenario 4: Access Control

1. Only authorized approvers can approve records
2. Only contract owner can add/remove approvers
3. Patients can only upload, not approve records

## üîç Verification Points

### Smart Contract Verification

- [ ] Contract compiles without errors
- [ ] All test cases pass (3/3 passing)
- [ ] Gas usage is reasonable
- [ ] Events are emitted correctly

### Frontend Verification

- [ ] Wallet connects successfully
- [ ] Records display correctly
- [ ] Approval workflow functions
- [ ] Error handling works

### Security Verification

- [ ] Access control prevents unauthorized approvals
- [ ] Patient data privacy is maintained
- [ ] IPFS hashes are properly formatted
- [ ] Timestamp accuracy is verified

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Contract Address

- **Local Network**: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
- **Network**: Hardhat Local (Chain ID: 31337)

### Test Accounts (from Hardhat)

- **Owner**: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`
- **Patient**: `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8`
- **Doctor**: `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`

### Environment Variables (for production)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_API_KEY=your_ipfs_api_key
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Configure network in hardhat.config.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### 2. Verify Contract

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration

- Update contract address in services
- Configure proper IPFS endpoints
- Set up production MetaMask networks

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to network localhost"**

   - Ensure Hardhat node is running (`npx hardhat node`)
   - Check if port 8545 is available

2. **MetaMask connection issues**

   - Add local network to MetaMask (RPC: http://localhost:8545, Chain ID: 31337)
   - Import test accounts using private keys from Hardhat

3. **Compilation errors**

   - Ensure Solidity version matches (0.8.20)
   - Check all imports are correct

4. **Test failures**
   - Verify contract ABI matches function signatures
   - Check test account permissions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check contract compilation
npx hardhat compile --force

# Run specific test
npx hardhat test test/test-functionality.js --grep "upload"

# Deploy with detailed logs
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost --verbose
```

## üìà Success Metrics

- **Smart Contract**: 3/3 tests passing
- **Deployment**: Contract deployed successfully
- **Frontend**: Wallet connection and UI interaction working
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow completed

## üéâ Conclusion

The blockchain functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. The system provides:

1. **Decentralized Storage**: Medical records stored on IPFS
2. **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable approval records
3. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
4. **Transparency**: Full audit trail of approvals
5. **Privacy**: Encrypted file storage with hash references

The implementation is ready for further development and production deployment with proper network configuration and security audits.
